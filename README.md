# Aperture Tile-Based Visual Analytics

New tools for raw data characterization of 'big data' are required to suggest initial hypotheses
for testing.  The widespread adoption of web-based maps provides a familiar set of interactions 
for exploring abstract large data spaces.  Building on these techniques, Aperture-Tiles provides 
browser-based visual analytics that that allow interactive visualization of billions or more 
points of data.

## What is this?
The Aperture-Tiles project aims to simplify understanding and characterization of large data sets.  
Aperture-Tiles provides a single, consistent tool that can be used to visualize the data at all 
scales.  This tool can be used whether one needs a broad overview of the entire data set, or a 
detailed picture of a small section of the data.

## Why?
Understanding the data one has in large data sets is a challenging process.  We are attempting to 
create a simple to use tool that allows one to examine the data visually, in summary, in detail, 
and everything in between.  We do this by applying a technique known as tiling.  Tiling comes from
mapping applications, and has a number of benefits:
* It can show different levels of maps at what is, at each level, an appropriate level of detail.
* It provides good compression on the data and efficient transportation of data, with bounded limits 
  to the amount of resources needed.
* It can be applied to any data for which an *aggregation function* can be defined.
