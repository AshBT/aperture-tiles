#User Guide

This page is designed for analysts who want to understand how to navigate the Aperture Tiles user interface and use the application to investigate and assess their own data sources.

The look and feel of each Aperture Tiles project is highly dependent on the source data to which it is configured. While the topics in this help system refer to the interface for one specific data set (Twitter posts in South America), many different configurations are available for the display of maps, layers and aggregated data points. Such customization options are noted where applicable.

Please note that fully functional example Aperture Tiles projects are available on the the [Demos](../../demos/) page. Copies of these demos are also available for your use in the Aperture Tiles source code.
