#User Guide

This page is designed for analysts who want to understand how to navigate the Aperture Tiles user interface and use the application to investigate and assess their own data sources.

The look and feel of each Aperture Tiles project is highly dependent on the source data to which it is configured. While the topics in this help system refer to the interface for one specific data set (Twitter SA), many different configurations are available for the display of maps, layers and clustering properties. Such customization options are noted in the help where applicable.

Please note that an example application using the example Kiva data is available for your use in the Influent source code. A second example utilizing Bitcoin transactions is also available.
